 * Testcase: execbuf fence accounting

 * We had a bug where we were falsely accounting upon reservation already
 * fenced buffers as occupying a fence register even if they did not require
 * one for the batch.
 *
 * We aim to exercise this by performing a sequence of fenced BLT
 * with 2*num_avail_fence buffers, but alternating which half are fenced in
